coref_draft [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mpvharmelen/coref_draft.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mpvharmelen/coref_draft)
=============

Description
----------
Implementation of Stanford multi-seive coreference resolution approach for Dutch.
This is a draft version of the code. An official first release will be made available on github/cltl upon completion and basic testing of the first version of the system.


Current implementation
----------------------

The current implementation works on naf input files parsed by Alpino (i.e. it works for Dutch).

Future plans:

- separate Alpino specific functions from general naf-extraction functions (extend to other languages)
- create library for English

Usage
----

From command line:

```{bash}
$ python multisieve_coreference < inputfile.naf
```

From python:

```{python}
from multisieve_coreference import process_coreference
process_coreference(naf_object)
```

Calling `process_coreference` will change the naf_object in-place by adding coref nodes (if any).

Gaps in mention spans (mostly left-out punctuation marks) are not filled by default. To make sure mentions only refer to consecutive spans, pass `-f` or `--fill-gaps` on the command line or call `process_coreference(naf_object, fill_gaps=True)`.

**!! NB !!** Singleton clusters are left out by default. To Include singleton clusters pass `-s` or `--include_singletons` on the command line or call `process_coreference(naf_object, include_singletons=True)`.


Issues
------
 - [ ] Mentions are not ordered at all, in contrast to the description of the algorithm by Lee et al. (2013)
 - [ ] Only one mention of the current coreference classes should be considered as antecedent candidate. See _3.2.1 Mention Selection in a Given Sieve_ in Lee et al. (2013)
 - [ ] Mention attributes are not shared among mentions in the same coreference class, in contrast to the description of the algorithm by Lee et al. (2013)
 - [ ] Alpino uses two types of dependencies ("deep" and "shallow"). Make sure these are handled correctly.
 - [ ] `global stop_words` should be a `set` (and not a global) and doesn't seem to be used consistently.
 - [X] `linguisticProcessors` layer should be added to `nafHeader`
 - [ ] `create_mention` docstring
 - [ ] `fem` and `masc` do not appear in output of Alpino, but _are_ used to identify gender
 - [ ] Many variables and functions use `id` in their name while they actually contain or use offsets.
 - [ ] Duplicate code in `resolve_relative_pronoun_structures` and `resolve_reflective_pronoun_structures`
 - [ ] `get_predicative_information` seems to miss some constructs
 - [X] ~~`dep2heads` shouldn't need lists as values because a dependency _tree_ is a tree.~~ Apparently dependency trees output by Alpino aren't always a tree.
 - [X] Add punctuation marks to mention spans in post processing **if** they are in the middle of the mention. They aren't in the span in the first place because punctuation is filtered out of the dependency tree to make sure punctuation that isn't in the middle of a mention is not included.
 - [ ] `post_process` should only allow adding punctuation in the gaps of a span
 - [ ] `Cmention.coreference_prohibited` does not seem to be used.
 - [ ] `check_if_quotation_contains_dependent` is a mess.


Design ideal
------------
Instead of passing around a bare dictionary of mentions, an iterable `MentionCollection` object would be a better idea because it would be able to take care of mention ordering and filtering.

It would be great if all changing information (mostly related to which mentions should or should not be in the same coreference class) is kept in one object, instead of spread out amongst the mention objects themselves. (This is currently the case with `Cmention.coreference_prohibited`.)

It would be even nicer if every sieve would inherit from some `Sieve` abstraction and these sieves could be easily plugged and played by moving them around in some input sequence.
